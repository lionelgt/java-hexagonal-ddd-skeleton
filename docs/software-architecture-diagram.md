## 🙏 Gratitude

The [software architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lionelgt/java-hexagonal-ddd-skeleton/main/docs/img/hexagonal-architecture.png) reflected in this repository is based on the previous work carried out by the architecture team of start-up [Tul](https://www.tul.io/), a company in which I previously worked.
I want to offer my special thanks.

I took the liberty of implementing this skeleton repository for Java projects with Spring Boot and Maven as a dependency manager. Additionally, I included an API example that covers all the layers to show the implementation in each of them.

**Note**: *Originally the architecture developed by the Tul team was implemented for kotlin projects with Spring boot and gradle as a dependency manager.*
